    "Q2. Name the four pillars of OOPs.\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS : The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: Encapsulation is the concept of wrapping data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, known as a class. It restricts direct access to some of an object’s components, which is a means of preventing accidental interference and misuse of the data.\n",
    "Example: In a class, you can use access modifiers like private, protected, or public to control access to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Abstraction:\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: Abstraction is the process of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. It simplifies interaction with objects by providing a clear and simple interface.\n",
    "Example: When you use a Car class, you interact with methods like start_engine() or stop_engine() without needing to know the intricate details of how these methods are implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: Inheritance is the mechanism by which one class (child or derived class) can inherit properties and methods from another class (parent or base class). It promotes code reusability and establishes a relationship between classes.\n",
    "Example: If you have a Vehicle class with common properties like make and model, you can create a Car class that inherits from Vehicle and adds specific properties like number_of_doors.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Polymorphism:\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It also allows a method to do different things based on the object it is acting upon, even if the method shares the same name.\n",
    "Example: A method named drive() might behave differently when called on an object of class Car compared to when it is called on an object of class Bike.\n"

    "\n",
    "Purpose of __init__():\n",
    "Initialize Attributes: It allows you to define and initialize the attributes of the object at the time of creation.\n",

    "Q4. Why self is used in OOPs?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS : In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python, self is used as the first parameter in methods within a class to refer to the instance of the class that is calling the method. It is a reference to the current object, and it allows access to the instance’s attributes and other methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Reasons for Using self:\n",
    "    \n",
    "Accessing Instance Variables:\n",
    "self allows you to access the instance variables (attributes) and methods of the class from within the class. Without self, Python would not know whether you are referring to a local variable or an instance variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Distinguishing Between Class and Instance Variables:\n",
    "Using self helps differentiate between class variables (shared among all instances) and instance variables (unique to each instance).\n",
    "\n",
    "Calling Other Methods in the Same Class:\n",
    "self is required to call other methods within the same class, ensuring that the method call is bound to the correct instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensuring Consistency Across Instances:\n",
    "self ensures that each instance of the class maintains its own set of attributes and methods, making each object unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "self is essential in Python's OOP to ensure that methods and attributes are properly associated with the specific instance of the class. It provides a way to work with an object's own data and behavior within the class's methods."
